# DronDelExperimentation
This repository contains an implementation of ideas outlined in the paper titled <Paper Name>. The code provided allows for the execution of specific instances and simultaneous runs through the use of Python scripts.

## Overview

The main functionality of this project is encapsulated within the run.py script. Within this script, you will find two primary functions:

## Single Run

The single_run() function facilitates the execution of the code for a single instance. This function internally calls the decode_reduced function, where parameters for the specific instance are set.

## Multi Run

The multi_run() function allows for running multiple instances simultaneously. This function also internally calls the decode_reduced function, where parameters for each instance are set.

## Usage

To utilize the provided functionality, follow these steps:

Open the run.py script.
Adjust the parameters for your specific instance within the decode_reduced function as needed for either single or multi runs.
Run the single_run() function to execute the code for a single instance, or run the multi_run() function to execute multiple instances simultaneously.
