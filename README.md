# DronDelExperimentation
This repository contains an implementation of ideas outlined in the paper titled <Paper Name>. The code provided allows for the execution of specific instances and simultaneous runs through the use of Python scripts.

## Overview
In this project you may find the code required to run the experiments as well as some of the maps we used, encoded in a way described in the InstanceFormat file.
The main functionality of this project is encapsulated within the run.py script. Within this script, you will find two primary functions:

- The single_run() function facilitates the execution of the code for a single instance. 

- The multi_run() function allows for running multiple instances simultaneously.

Both of those functions use the decode_reduced() function, in which the parameters for the needed instances are set as well as the path to the folder in which they are located. 


## Usage

To utilize the provided functionality, follow these steps:

Open the run.py script.
Adjust the parameters for wanted instances within the single_run or multi_run function.
Run the single_run() function to execute the code for a single instance, or run the multi_run() function to execute multiple instances simultaneously.
